The intersection between technology and common sense - go for the simple solution. There were times where it seemed like he would cry all day and all night breaking for a quick nap and feeding. Naturally we spent those first 8 weeks trying to figure out why he was crying so much and how how we could fix it. My background as an engineer lead me to attempt to solve the issue with a pure technological approach. White noise app. Baby lullaby app. Use the swing. Google this. Google that. Sometimes it helped, but the technology was only ancillary, a side dish, a feature. My wife on the other hand shifted into maternal mode. She soothed him with song, held and rocked him for hours, and reassured him with her tender touch. It was exhausting work, but it was what he needed. She taught me an important lesson - it can take the most time and effort to arrive to the simplest solution.

Technology can be a feature, a mere side dish to a more simple product. Finding that simplicity can be more time intensive and physically draining. But it may just be the key to creating a more holistic solution that stands the test of time.
