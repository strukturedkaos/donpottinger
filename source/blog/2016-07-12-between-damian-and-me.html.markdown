Your large brown eyes burn holes into my mind. It's as if you know there is something I'm not telling you. How are you are already noticing the differences in color between your mother, your father and yourself? You are not even 3 years old. How did we get here so soon?

Your innocent questions make me uncomfortable. In fact, the entire question of color in America has always been an uncomfortable one.  How do I even start? Being Black in America is complicated. As biracial, things will be even more complicated for you. You will have the power to navigate between both worlds like some sort of racial superhero.At times, this will be an advantage, and other times it won't.

Realistically, most people will take one look at your light brown skin and African features and quickly classify you as a Black man. That means that you will feel their eyes following you as you shop in a store. You will sense their discomfort in tight spaces. You will smell their fear and suspicion as you approach them on the street. You will learn what it means to be Black and assumed dangerous.

When you are older, I will tell you about the time that your uncle, grandmother, her elderly friend and I were stopped by the police. It was close to midnight in the middle of nowhere Alabama. I made sure to pull into a well-lit gas station, so the officer wouldn't feel threatened. They still surrounded our silver Honda Accord with multiple units as if we had any intention of making a getaway. As multiple officers approached on both sides of our car. Although they blinded us with their flashlights, I could still their hands on their weapons. Throughout the encounter, the officer addressed me with a hostile tone. I responded with an air of compliance and diffusion. He treated us as if we were wanted for a serious crime. My mistake - forgetting to turn off my high beams.

As we drove away, we were rattled. We felt lucky to escape with just a $129 ticket. But that's the reality of police encounters for Black people. There is fear on both sides.

I will teach you how to assuage those fears as best as I can. In light of recent events, this will be crucial to increasing your chances of survival in encounters with the police. I will teach you how to silence your inquisitiveness and desire to question authority. I will teach you how to be as unthreatening as possible to avoid triggering the flight or fight responses of the police. You will survive. At least I hope so.

I will tell you how angry I was for weeks after that encounter. I won't tell you how I imagined ways to make that officer feel that same helplessness and fear. Unfortunately, this emasculation is something that Black men have been experiencing since the genesis of this country from slavery to Jim Crow to the present. You will learn about this too.

As your father, I want to protect you from anyone and anything that can harm you. The reality is that I can't. I can't protect you from the systemic racism that plagues our country. I will instill a healthy fear in you about what it means to be Black in America. Just like my parents did before me. Why? Because to be a Black man means, first and foremost, to survive.
