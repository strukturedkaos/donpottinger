The intersection between technology and common sense - go for the simple solution. There were times where it seemed like he would cry all day and all night only taking breaks for quick naps and feedings. Naturally, we spent those first 8 weeks trying to figure out why he was crying so much and how we could fix it. My background as an engineer lead me to attempt to solve the issue systematically with the aide of technology. White noise app. Baby lullaby app. Use the swing. Google this. Google that. Some things helped, but the technology was only a temporary distraction for the baby.

My wife took a more maternal and natural approach. She soothed him with song, held and rocked him for hours, and reassured him with her tender touch. It was exhausting work, but it was exactly what he needed. Eventually, the baby would learn how to self-soothe, but until then this manual process She taught me an important lesson - it can take the most time and effort to arrive to the simplest solution.

Technology can be ancillary, a mere side dish to a more simple solution. Finding that simplicity can be more time intensive and physically draining. But it may just be the key to creating a more holistic solution that stands the test of time.
