I had lunch with Chae. She's a friend, an ex-coworker, and a great lunch buddy. She understands the nuanced balance between actively talking and actively listening. The lunch spot was [Sobban Korean Southern diner](http://www.sobban.com/), fusion cuisine at it's finest. Catching up on each other's lives happened between bites of delicious Chicken Kalguksu, Japche and Korean fried chicken wings. Yum. During our hour-long conversation, we touched on a number of subjects - family, work, and professional development. But, one story stood out.

One afternoon, Chae and her husband were standing outside of a very popular Korean restaurant in Korea Town in New York. They were meeting her parents for lunch. Chae was on the phone, giving them directions to the restaurant. As Chae's parents approached the restaurant, they walked right past her. In fact, they didn't recognize their own daughter. How was that even possible? Well, she is Korean. Her adoptive parents are white Americans. When she told me this story, we both just laughed.

On the way back to work, I kept replaying Chae's story in my head. Something stood out to me more than the obvious *The Onion* headline, "White Parents Don't Recognize Korean Daughter in Korea Town."

Then I came to the realization. Our laughter was an expression of a mutual understanding. It's an experience that we all share as minorities - being a stereotype. In Chae's case, she was invisible. In my case, I am inherently dangerous.

Battling this type of stereotype is an ever-present struggle for me. I navigate environments where people are trying to reconcile the Don they see with their deeply engrained stereotypes and the negative images perpetuated in the media about Black men. At times, this silent battle can feel like it's in my own head. It's hidden in plain sight. But it's not long before I'm hit with a reminder that it's real. It often manifests itself as a seemingly innocent question:

> <br>
>  Person: "Where are you from?" <br>
>  Me: "I'm from Atlanta." <br>
>  Person (perplexed and unsatisfied): "Where are you originally from?" <br>
>  Me: "Ohh, you are attempting to classify me because I don't match your prejudices about how people like me talk, look and carry themselves." <br>

Ok, I don't really say that last part. However, this happens often enough that I've become an expert at identifying the underlying motive behind this line of questioning.

As a result, I make a gargantuan effort to bend perceptions and frame my narrative. From the clothes I wear, to how I style my hair, to how often I smile, my entire appearance is carefully crafted to not only be seen, but to leave a positive impression on every person with whom I come in contact.

It's a small attempt to reverse the negative polarity surrounding Black men. That is to burst stereotypes about what an engineer looks and acts like. About what an entrepreneur looks like. About what a loving husband and father look like.

From the clothes you wear, to how you carry yourself, to the expressions on your face, everything about you tells a story. How are you framing your narrative? What are you doing in your every day life to make sure that you don't blend in, but stand out?
