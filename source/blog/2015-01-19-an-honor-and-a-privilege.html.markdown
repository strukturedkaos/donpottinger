I had the honor and privilege to be a part a [group reading](https://soundcloud.com/williejackson/dr-martin-luther-kings-letter-from-birmingham-jail) of Dr. Martin Luther King Jrâ€™s Letter from a Birmingham Jail. It's a powerful letter that touches on broad reaching subjects. His words resonate today just as much as they did way back in 1963. You can hear me around the 39th minute.

Many thanks to Willie Jackson for organizing the entire project.
