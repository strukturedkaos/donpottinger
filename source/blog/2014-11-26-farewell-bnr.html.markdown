Today is my last day at [Big Nerd Ranch (BNR)](http://www.bignerdranch.com).

To truly understand how meaningful my time at BNR has been, I have to take you back to 2011. It had been 3 years since I graduated from Georgia Tech. 3 years since I decided to turn my back on my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering to pursue a career in consulting. I had just accepted an offer to move from a Big 4 consulting firm to a smaller firm. I was excited - I had successfully negotiated a nice pay bump, and I would no longer have to worry about traveling for a project since this smaller firm operated a local project model.

However, it wasn't long before the euphoria of the new job was replaced with dread. The name of my employer may have changed, but I ended up doing the same unfulfilling management consulting work for huge corporations. When work got slow, as it ultimately does, I was still trapped in my cubicle from 9 to 5.

Not surprisingly, I looked forward to the end of the work day. Not because I got to veg out on the couch, but because it was the beginning of my 5 to 9. I had been working on a side project with my brother and a couple friends for the past year. Little did I know that this side project would lead me to my new career.

Our side project ended up growing into a full-fledged startup called [Body Boss](http://bodybossfitness.com). In an effort to build Body Boss, I spent nights and weekends learning how to build web applications. The challenge and frustration of coding was addictive. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. I had discovered my passion for software development. When those nights and weekends bled into days and weekdays, I knew that it was time to make a career switch. By the end of 2011, I had begun applying to software engineering positions, but it would be months before I would find the perfect role at BNR.

It was March of 2012 when [Charles Brian Quinn](http://seebq.com), CEO of BNR (formerly Highgroove Studios), took a chance that "Consultant Don" could also become "Lead Software Engineer Don" and "Team Manager Don". Big Nerd Ranch offered me a bridge between my 3 worlds - consulting, entrepreneurship and software development. I would build products for clients, and a lot of my clients happened to be startups. Furthermore, I'd be working in a Results-Only Work Environment (ROWEâ„¢) meaning that I could work wherever and whenever I wanted as long as I met my results. No more 9 to 5. No more sitting in an office unless I wanted to. I was absolutely thrilled for this amazing opportunity and also terrified because I had no idea what being a professional software engineer meant.

When I first started at BNR, I had a serious case of impostor syndrome. Could you blame me? Up to this point, my only serious coding experience was on Body Boss. Now I was surrounded by amazingly talented and smart software engineers. I was certain that it was was only a matter of time before I would be exposed. Fortunately, my new coworkers were not the types to exploit a very green engineer. In fact, they made a concerted effort to help me become a better software engineer.

Taking the time to help each other grow was ingrained in BNR's culture. My coworkers patiently and diligently coached me, pair-programmed with me, and code reviewed me. They taught me that software engineers are comfortable being uncomfortable because we are always asking questions and, as a result, always learning. With their help, I transformed from being someone that hacked things together to a craftsman that took pride in building well-designed software.

I donned many hats during my time at BNR. I was a...

  * __consultant__ - advising and helping CEOs and CTOs define and implement their strategic vision.
  * __lead engineer__ - driving the technical development for clients big and small.
  * __team manager__ - leading and advocating for an amazing team of developers.
  * __tech sales engineer__ - estimating projects and helping potential clients understand the technical requirements of their project.
  * __backup dancer__ - featuring in my first (and probably last) music video.

BNR was the best place I've ever worked. By far. It's not even close. I worked with some of the most brilliant, most hardworking and kindest Nerds. As you can see in the above video, we had a lot of fun too. We would go from seriously discussing a software design pattern to posting hilarious GIFs of cats in our company chatroom to putting on silly masks in a team Google+ Hangout.

To put it simply, I've made life long friends. I'm going to miss them dearly. That's why it's with mixed emotions that I bid farewell to The Ranch. I depart to undertake a new challenge at [Kevy](http://kevy.com) with a confidence instilled, in large part, by my time at BNR. I'm not an impostor anymore. Thank you, Big Nerd Ranch.
