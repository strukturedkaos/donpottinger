Today is my last day at [Big Nerd Ranch (BNR)](http://www.bignerdranch.com).

It was April of 2012 when [Charles Brian Quinn](http://seebq.com), CEO of BNR (formerly Highgroove Studios), took a chance that "IT/Management Consultant Don" and "Startup Don" could also become "Lead Software Engineer Don" and "Team Manager Don". I'm forever grateful for that opportunity.

When I first started at BNR, I had a serious case of impostor syndrome. I felt that I didn't belong amongst such talented and smart software engineers, and it was only a matter of time before I would be exposed. I worked hard, but it's safe to say that I wouldn't have succeeded without the support of my fellow Nerds.

I learned so much from my teammates. Helping each other grow and sharing knowledge was ingrained in BNR's culture. They paired with me, code reviewed me, and coached me. They taught me that software engineers are comfortable being uncomfortable because we are always learning. I transformed from being someone that hacked things together to a craftsman that took pride in building well-designed software.

I donned many hats during my time at BNR. I was a...

  * __consultant__ - advising and helping CEOs and CTOs define and implement their strategic vision.
  * __lead engineer__ - driving the technical development for clients big and small.
  * __team manager__ - leading and advocating for an amazing team of developers.
  * __tech sales engineer__ - estimating projects and helping potential clients understand the technical requirements of their project.
  * __backup dancer__ in a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk1VWhToP5w).

BNR was the best place I've ever worked. By far. It's not even close. I worked with some of the most brilliant, most hardworking and kindest Nerds. I've made life long friends. I'm going to miss them dearly.

That's why it's with mixed emotions that I bid farewell to The Ranch. I depart to undertake a new challenge at [Kevy](http://kevy.com) with a confidence instilled, in large part, by my time at BNR. I'm not an impostor anymore. Thank you, Big Nerd Ranch.
