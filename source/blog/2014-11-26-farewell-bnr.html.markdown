After almost 3 years, I'm bidding farewell to [Big Nerd Ranch (BNR)](http://www.bignerdranch.com). It was April of 2012 when [Charles Brian Quinn](http://seebq.com), CEO of BNR, took a chance that "IT/Management Consultant Don" and "Startup Don" could also become "Software Engineer Don" and "Product Engineer Don". I'm forever grateful for that opportunity.

When I first started at BNR (formerly Highgroove Studios), I had a serious case of impostor syndrome. I felt that I didn't belong amongst such talented and smart software engineers.

They code reviewed me with impunity. They were so technically savvy. I was I learned so much from my teammates because helping each other was ingrained in the culture. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced. I went from being a lone wolf to

I donned many hats during my time at BNR. I was...

  * a consultant - helping CEOs and CTOs define and implement their strategic vision.
  * a lead engineer - leading the technical development for clients big and small.
  * a team manager - advocating for an amazing team of developers.
  * a tech sales engineer - estimating projects and helping potential clients through the sales process.
  * [a backup dancer in a music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk1VWhToP5w).

BNR was the best place I've ever worked. By far. It's not even close. I worked with some of the most brilliant, most hardworking and kindest "nerds". I've made life long friends. I'm going to miss them dearly.

That's why it's with mixed emotions that I depart to take on a new challenge. I can say that I  to my next opportunity with no trepidation because BNR instilled confidence in me. The type of confidence that I know that I can solve any problem. I'm not an impostor anymore.
