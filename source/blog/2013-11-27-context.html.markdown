Context is important when solving a problem. Life's experiences provide that necessary opportunity to identify a problem. More importantly, it gives you the context that enables you to solve that problem.

That's why it's so important to not only talk to your potential customer, but to also take a minute to walk in their shoes. Look at the problem through their eyes, then take a step back, and build a solution that they would want to use.
